# Image Processing Application

This project is a basic image processing application written in C++. It allows you to apply various filters and transformations to grayscale `.bmp` images of size 256x256 pixels.

## Features

1. **Black and White Filter**: Converts the image to a black-and-white format.
2. **Invert Colors**: Inverts the grayscale values of the image.
3. **Flip Image**: Flips the image horizontally or vertically.
4. **Mirror Image**: Mirrors the image in the left, right, upper, or lower direction.
5. **Rotate Image**: Rotates the image clockwise by 90°, 180°, or 270°.
6. **Edge Detection**: Detects edges in the image using pixel differences.
7. **Crop Image**: Crops a specific region of the image based on user input.
8. **Enlarge Image**: Enlarges one of the four quadrants of the image.
9. **Shuffle Image**: Rearranges the image quadrants in a user-defined order.
10. **Shrink Image**: Shrinks the image to 1/2, 1/3, or 1/4 of its original size.
